# Cumulo - Story Mainnet Uptime Report (since 2025-11-24)

## Validator
- **Moniker:** Cumulo  
- **Network:** Story Mainnet  
- **Validator Operator Address:** storyvaloper13mdyx6lpu0euma7c6pcdk6mpca572c36nd9uly  
- **Consensus Address (HEX):** B93DD4D30F2837187D6BF66C6D53799F2E1A1272  

## Active Set Since
- **Date:** 2025-11-24 (UTC)

## Purpose of this document

This document is provided as **Mainnet Uptime Proof** for the Story delegation application process.

It reports the **effective validator uptime** of **Cumulo** on Story Mainnet from the exact date the validator joined the **active set** (2025-11-24) up to the present, using a **custom, on-chain verifiable methodology**.

---

## Methodology

To ensure accuracy and transparency, we did **not rely on explorer-level abstractions** or generic uptime metrics.

Instead, we used a **custom analysis method based entirely on on-chain data**, with the following approach:

1. Convert the delegation start date (**2025-11-24 UTC**) into the corresponding **block height** using block timestamps.
2. Query an **archive RPC** with full historical data retention.
3. Iterate over block heights from the start date to the latest block.
4. Inspect each block’s consensus commit:
   ```
   block.last_commit.signatures[].validator_address
   ```
5. Verify whether the validator **consensus address (valcons)** appears in the commit.
6. Count:
   - blocks where the validator signed (active participation)
   - blocks where the validator did not sign (consensus-level unavailability)
7. Compute the resulting **validator consensus uptime**.

This method measures **actual participation in consensus**, which is the metric relevant for validator reliability and delegation programs.

## Data source

- **Archive RPC used:**  
  https://rpc-archive.story.node75.org

- **Analysis script:**  
  https://github.com/Cumulo-pro/Story_protocol/blob/main/validator-uptime-proof/story-uptime-since-date.sh

- **Raw uptime output (JSON):**  
  https://github.com/Cumulo-pro/Story_protocol/blob/main/validator-uptime-proof/Cumulo%20-%20Story%20Mainnet%20Uptime%20Proof%20(since%202025-11-24%2C%20step10).json

All results are **fully reproducible** by any third party using the same inputs.

---

## Analysis parameters

- **Start date:** 2025-11-24 00:00:00 UTC  
- **Start block height:** 11,143,250  
- **End block height:** 12,812,927  
- **Sampling step:** 10 blocks (high-precision sampling)  
- **Blocks evaluated:** 166,968  

Sampling was chosen to balance **accuracy and performance** while remaining statistically robust for long time ranges.

---

## Results

- **Blocks signed:** 166,624  
- **Blocks missing:** 344  
- **Estimated validator uptime:** **99.794%**

A “missing” block indicates that the validator did not participate in consensus for that block, which can be caused by brief restarts, synchronization gaps, or other transient events. From the network’s perspective, these cases represent validator unavailability at the consensus level.

---

## Interpretation

- This report measures **validator consensus uptime**, not server or RPC uptime.
- Consensus uptime reflects the validator’s real availability to the network.
- The methodology ensures that uptime is calculated **exactly from the date Cumulo entered the active validator set**, without approximation.

---

## Conclusion

Since joining the Story Mainnet active validator set on **2025-11-24**, **Cumulo** has maintained a **high and consistent level of participation in consensus**, with an estimated uptime of **99.794%** over the evaluated period.

This report is submitted as **relevant Mainnet uptime documentation**, generated using a transparent, reproducible, and on-chain verifiable methodology.
